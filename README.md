# BlurOb Plugin

This repository contains a minimal Obsidian plugin example.

## Building

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the plugin
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The compiled files will be placed in the `dist` directory and `manifest.json` points to `dist/main.js` as the plugin entry point.
